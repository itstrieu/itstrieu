My passion for data science was sparked during my extensive five-year tenure with Viet Tan, where I witnessed the transformative synergy of technology and human rights advocacy firsthand. Through championing human rights and leveraging technology to empower Vietnamese individuals against restrictions on freedom, I developed a deep-seated commitment to data-driven solutions. My role as the editor of Loa, a Viet Tan podcast, and my exploration of data journalism further nurtured this passion.

This profound experience motivated me to pursue advanced studies at Texas A&M University, where I earned an M.S. in Statistics. This academic journey deepened my theoretical foundation and cultivated practical expertise essential for advancing in data science.

Beyond academia, my leadership as a project manager at Viet Tan involved spearheading advocacy campaigns and conducting impactful training sessions. As the founder of the SGV Data Science Group and LA Techâ€™s AI Book Club, I foster collaboration and innovation within the tech community.

Fluent in English and Vietnamese, with conversational Mandarin, I navigate diverse environments adeptly in pursuit of impactful data solutions.

I am eager to integrate my expertise with my passion for human rights. Let's connect and collaborate!
