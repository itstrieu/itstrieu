:cyclone: Hi there! I'm Kathy Trieu, a recent MS Statistics graduate with a unique background.

My journey began with a BA in Asian Studies, where I delved into Chinese society, history, and language. Later, I furthered my understanding of current political affairs in China, intertwining my passion for human rights advocacy. While working with Viet Tan, I contributed to empowering Vietnamese people to roll back restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. During the pandemic, my interest in data science blossomed, leading me to enhance my skills in statistics, R, and Python. Now, I'm eager to merge my expertise with my passion for human rights and contribute meaningfully to impactful projects. ðŸŒŸ Let's connect and collaborate!
