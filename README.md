My interest in data science was ignited by over five years of work with Viet Tan, during which I witnessed firsthand the potent combination of technology and human rights advocacy. Championing human rights and leveraging technology to empower Vietnamese individuals to resist restrictions on freedom fueled my passion for data-driven solutions. Additionally, working as the editor of Loa, a Viet Tan podcast, and learning about data journalism further contributed to my blossoming interest.

This experience propelled me to pursue advanced studies at Texas A&M University (go Aggies!), where I earned an M.S. in Statistics to deepen my theoretical understanding and cultivate practical expertise crucial for advancing my skills in data science.

In addition to my academic and professional background, I have made significant contributions as a project manager at Viet Tan, leading advocacy campaigns and training sessions. As the founder of the SGV Data Science Group and LA Techâ€™s AI Book Club, I promote collaboration and innovation within the tech community.

Fluent in English and Vietnamese, with conversational Mandarin, I am equipped to navigate diverse environments in my pursuit of impactful data solutions.

I am excited to merge my expertise with my passion for human rights. Let's connect and collaborate!
