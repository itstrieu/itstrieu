During my over 5 years with Viet Tan, I championed human rights and empowered Vietnamese people to push back against restrictions on freedom. My BA in Asian Studies, specializing in Chinese political history, deepened my understanding of China's political landscape, laying the groundwork for my work with Viet Tan.

My interest in data science surged through my research on Vietnam. I further honed my statistical modeling, R, and Python skills while studying at Texas A&M University (go Aggies!).

I am excited to merge my expertise with my passion for human rights. Let's connect and collaborate!
