With skills in:

* **Advanced Statistical modeling** (regression analysis, time series, generalized linear models (GLMs).
* **Data management** (SQL, NoSQL), big data tools (HPC clusters, Git), R, and Python.
* **Machine Learning** (supervised/unsupervised learning, ensemble methods).
* **Statistical consulting** client relations, storytelling, and communication.
* **Programming** proficiency in Python and R for data analysis, visualization, and mining.

My interest in data science was ignited by my over 5 years of work with [Viet Tan](https://viettan.org/en/), where I witnessed firsthand the potent combination of technology and human rights advocacy. Championing human rights and leveraging technology to empower Vietnamese individuals to resist restrictions on freedom fueled my passion for data-driven solutions. 

This experience propelled me to pursue advanced studies at Texas A&M University (go Aggies!), where I aimed to deepen my theoretical understanding and cultivate practical expertise crucial for advancing my skills in data science.

I am excited to merge my expertise with my passion for human rights. Let's connect and collaborate!
