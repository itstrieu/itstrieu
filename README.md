# Hi, I'm Kathy!  

**Data Scientist | Machine Learning Specialist | Community Builder**  

I specialize in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization, with a passion for AI innovation and social impact. Holding an M.S. in Statistics from Texas A&M University, I focus on ensuring the quality of training data and code across multiple languages to enhance LLaMA 4's coding capabilities at Meta.  

As the founder of the [Los Angeles AI Network](https://www.meetup.com/los-angeles-ai-network/) (formerly San Gabriel Valley Data Science Group) and the [LA Tech AI Book Club](https://www.meetup.com/la-tech-meetups/), I bring people together to explore advancements in AI and drive impactful solutions. Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on meaningful projects!
