I am a data scientist passionate about leveraging technology for social impact, with a focus on machine learning and deep learning. My commitment to data-driven solutions began during my five years with Viet Tan, where I advocated for human rights and witnessed the power of technology to effect change.

With an M.S. in Statistics from Texas A&M University, I bring expertise in statistical modeling, machine learning techniques, and data visualization. I’m also experienced in data wrangling and testing methodologies, including unittest and pytest. As the founder of the SGV Data Science Group and the LA Tech AI Book Club, I foster collaboration and innovation within the tech community.

Currently, I’m exploring machine learning engineering, AI ethics, and deep learning applications. Fluent in English and Vietnamese, with conversational Mandarin, I’m eager to connect and collaborate on impactful projects.
